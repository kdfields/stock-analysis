# VBA Stock Analysis

## Project Overview

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to edit, or refactor, the existing code used to measure stock performance for 12 stocks in 2017 and 2018.  The goal was to make the code more efficient through the refactoring process.

## Results
The code for the question prompt and input box, table header, header rows, and activating the correct worksheet were already provided.  Below are the question prompts and the VBA code I provided.

## Summary
### Advantages and Disadvantages of Refactoring VBA Code
The benefit of refactoring is it leads to better quality code because through the process we can find bugs, make the program fun faster, make it easier to read, and overall improves the design of the software. Making the code easier to read and understand is of particular benefit for those using our code later.  Some disadvantages of refactoring are the process can be very time consuming (particularly with very large code), can potentially introduce new bugs, and can be very costly.

### Advantages and Disadvantage of Refactored Stock Analysis VBA
The most obvious advantage of refactoring the Stock Analysis VBA were faster macro run times.  The original code for 2017 and 2018 both took over a second to run the macro, while the refactored codes both ran in less than 0.3 seconds.
